## Old School String Formatting
Before Python 3.6, you had 2 main ways of embedding Python expressions inside string literals for formatting:
 - % formatting
 - `str.format()`

### % formatting

```python
name = "Eric"
print('Hello, %s.' % name)                                                                          #Hello, Eric.

name = "Eric"
age = 74
print('Hello, %s. You are %s years old.' % (name, age))                                             #Hello, Eric. You are 74 years old.
```

#### Why % formatting is not great
It can get a bit clunky to use all of these values and dynamically replace each of the `%s` space holders.

```python
first_name = "Eric"
last_name = "Idle"
age = 74
profession = "Comedian"
affiliation = "Monty Python"
print("Hello, %s %s. You are %s years old. You are a %s. You were a member of %s." % (first_name, last_name, age, profession, affiliation))   #Hello, Eric Idle. You are 74 years old.  You are a Comedian.  You were a member of Monty Python.
```

## `str.format()`
```python
name = "Eric"
age = 74
print("Hello, {}. You are {} years old.".format(name, age))                                         #Hello, Eric. You are 74 years old.

name = "Eric"
age = 74
print("Hello, {1}. You are {0} years old.".format(age, name))                                       #Hello, Eric. You are 74 years old.

person = {'name': 'Eric', 'age': 74}
print("Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old.".format(name=person['name'], age=person['age']))     #Hello, Eric. You are 74 years old.     

person = {'name': 'Eric', 'age': 74}
print("Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old.".format(**person))                                   #Hello, Eric. You are 74 years old.
```

### Why `str.format()` is not great
This doesn't seem to be much better either.

```python
first_name = "Eric"
last_name = "Idle"
age = 74
profession = "Comedian"
affiliation = "Monty Python"
print(("Hello, {first_name} {last_name}. You are {age} years old. " + 
       "You are a {profession}. You were a member of {affiliation}.") \
       .format(first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name, age=age, \
               profession=profession, affiliation=affiliation))                                     #Hello, Eric Idle. You are 74 years old. You are a Comedian. You were a member of Monty Python.
```

## Introducing f-strings: A New and Improved Way to Format Strings in Python
Also called "formatting string literals", f-strings are string literals that have an f at the beginning and curly braces ({}) containing expressions that will be replaced with their values.
Their expressions are evaluated at runtime and formatted using the __format__ protocol.

### Simple Syntax

```python
name = "Eric"
age = 74

print(f"Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old.")                                                   #Hello, Eric. You are 74 years old.
print(F"Hello, {name}. You are {age} years old.")                                                   #Hello, Eric. You are 74 years old.
```

### Arbitrary Expressions
Since f-string are evaluated at runtime, you can put any and all valid Python expressions in them.

```python
print(f"{2 * 37}")                                                                                  #74
```

You can also call functions.

```python
def to_lowercase(input):
    return input.lower()

name = 'Eric Idle'
print(f"{to_lowercase(name)} is a funny guy.")                                                      #eric idle is a funny guy.
```

You also have the option of calling a method directly.

```python
name = 'Eric Idle'
print(f"{name.lower()} is a funny guy.")                                                            #eric idle is a funny guy.
```

You could even use objects created from classes with f-strings.

The `__str__()` and `__repr__()` methods deal with how objects are presented as strings.
- You must include include at least 1 of these methods in the class definition.
- The `__repr__()` is superior since it can be used in place of `__str__()`.
 - The string returned by `__str__()` is the informal string representation of an object and should be readable.
 - The string returned by `__repr__()` is the official representation an should be unambiguous.
 - Calling `str()` and `repr()` is preferable to using `__str__()` and `__repr__()` directly.
 - By default, f-strings will use `__str__()`, but you can make sure they use `__repr__()` with the `!r` conversion flag.

```python
class Comedian:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.age = age

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name} is {self.age} years old."
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name} is {self.age} years old. Surprise!"

new_comedian = Comedian("Eric", "Idle", "74")
print(f"{new_comedian}")                                                                            #Eric Idle is 74 years old.
print(f"{new_comedian!r}")                                                                          #Eric Idle is 74 years old. Surprise!
```

## Multiline f-Strings

```python
first_name = "Eric"
last_name = "Idle"
age = 74
profession = "Comedian"
affiliation = "Monty Python"

message1 = (
    f"Hi {name}. "
    f"You are {age} years old. "
    f"You are a {profession}. "
    f"You were a member of {affiliation}."
)

print(message1)                                                                                      #Hi Eric Idle. You are 74 years old. You are a Comedian. You were a member of Monty Python.

message2 = f"Hi {name}. " \
           f"You are {age} years old. " \
           f"You are a {profession}. " \
           f"You were a member of {affiliation}."

print(message2)                                                                                     #Hi Eric Idle. You are 74 years old. You are a Comedian. You were a member of Monty Python.
```

## Python f-Strings: The Pesky Details

### Quotation Marks
You can use various types of quotation marks.
Just be sure you are not using the same type of quotation mark on the outside of the f-string as you are using in the expression.

```python
n = f"{'Eric Idle'}"
print(n)                                                                                            #Eric Idle

n = f'{"Eric Idle"}'
print(n)                                                                                            #Eric Idle

n = f"""Eric Idle"""
print(n)                                                                                            #Eric Idle

n = f'''Eric Idle'''
print(n)                                                                                            #Eric Idle

name = "Eric"
age = 74
n = f"The \"comedian\" named {name} is {age} years old."
print(n)                                                                                            #The "comedian" named Eric is 74 years old.
```

### Dictionaries
If you are going to use single quotation marks ('') for the keys, you must use double quotation marks ("") for the f-string containing the keys.

```python
comedian = {'name': 'Eric Idle', 'age': 74}
n = f"The comedian is {comedian['name']} and he is {comedian['age']} years old."
print(n)                                                                                            #The comedian is Eric Idle and he is 74 years old.
```

### Braces
In order to make a brace appear in your string, you must use double braces ({{}}).

```python
n = f"{{70 + 4}}"
print(n)                                                                                            #{70 + 4}
```

Triple braces ({{{}}}) will result in there being only single braces ({}).

```python
n = f"{{{70 + 4}}}"
print(n)                                                                                            #{74}
```

You can get more braces to show if you use more than triple braces.

```python
n = f"{{{{70 + 4}}}}"
print(n)                                                                                            #{{70 + 4}}
```

### Backslashes
You can use backslash (\) escapes in the string portion of an f-string, but not as escapes in the expression part of an f-string.

```python
n = f"{\"Eric Idle\"}"
print(n)                                                                                           #Syntax Error: f-string expression part cannot include a backslash
```

You can work around this by evaluating the expression beforehand and using the result in the f-string.

```python
name = "Eric Idle"
n = f"{name}"
print(n)                                                                                            #Eric Idle
```

### Inline Comments
Expressions should not include comments using the `#` symbol.

```python
n = f"Eric is {2 * 37 #Oh my!}."
print(n)     
```
